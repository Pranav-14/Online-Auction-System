# Online-Auction-System
This project presents an online auctioning system that
enables users to bid on a variety of items and create listings
to host bids.
The system allows users to view ongoing and active bids,
search for items, place bids, and track their bid history.
Sellers can create listings and manage their auctions,
including setting starting prices and bid increments, and
viewing the bid history of their items.
The system includes features such as users to be able to
leave comments on the items, create their watchlist on set
of ongoing auctions.
The goal of the project is to provide a convenient and userfriendly
platform for buying and selling items through an
auction system.
The project also can be accessed by administrator with
super-user rights and can be used for the basic operations
that are CRUD functionalities.
